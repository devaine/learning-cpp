### 1.1.1 Introduction
* Chapter 1 provides:
    * an overview of the book
    * hints on how to use it
    * background info about C++ and its general use

* Encouraged to skim through *Chapter 1* and look what sparks interest and return after reading other parts of the book.

* <ins>Don't feel obligated to read the entirety of Chapter 1</ins>

* Chapter 2:
    * Describes C++'s model of memory, computation, and error handling.

* Chapter 3: 
    * Presenting features that support data abstraction, object-oriented programming, and generic programming

* Chapter 5: 
    * Outlines the standard-library utilities related to managing resources, concurrency, mathematical computtaion, regular expressions and more.

* Chapter 6:
    * *Types and Declarations*: Fundamental types, naming, initialization, simple decution, object lifeitmes, and type aliases

* Chapter 7:
    * *Pointers, Arrays, and References*

    * *Structures, Unions, and Enumerations*

* Chapter 9:
    * *Statements:* Declarations as statements, selections statements (*if* and *switch*), iterations statements (*for*, *while*, and *do*), *goto* and comments.

* Chapter 10:
    * *Expressions:* Examples, survey of oprators, ocnstant expressios, and implicity type conversion.

* Chapter 11:
    * *Select Operations:* Locagical operators, the conditional expression, increment and decrement, free store (*new* and *delete*) {}-lists, lamda expressions, and explicit type conversion (*static_cast* and *const_cast*)

* Chapter 12:
    * *Functions:* Function declarations and definitions, *inline* functions, *constepr* functions, arguemnt passing, overloaded functions, pre- and post-conditions, pointers to fucntions, and macros

* Chapter 13:
    * *Exception Handling:* Styles of error handling ,exception guarantees, resource management, enforcing invariants, *throw* and *catch*, a *vector* implementation

* Chapter 14:
